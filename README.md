- **JavaScript Functionality**: Implemented form validation, theme switching, and interactive features
- **Accessibility Implementation**: Built-in WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation
- **Content Structure**: Generated placeholder content and professional layout templates

### Phase 2: Content Personalization & Integration
**AI Role**: Content customization and personal information integration
- **Personal Data Integration**: Updated all placeholder content with actual personal information (name, email, education, experience)
- **Resume Content**: Populated resume page with real academic and professional background
- **About Page Development**: Created personalized bio and professional summary
- **Contact Information**: Integrated real contact details and social media links
- **Image Placeholder Setup**: Structured image system for headshots and project screenshots

### Phase 3: Design System & Theme Development
