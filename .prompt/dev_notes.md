# AI Development Notes

## Prompts Log
> Log at least 3 prompts used with Cursor/Copilot/etc. For each, paste the prompt, summarize the output (or paste a short snippet), and state whether you accepted, modified, or rejected itâ€”and why.

### Prompt 1
- **Prompt:** "Create a complete personal website with 6 HTML pages, responsive CSS, and JavaScript form validation for a university assignment. Include accessibility features, semantic HTML, and placeholder content."
- **AI Output (summary or snippet):** Generated a comprehensive website structure with index.html, about.html, resume.html, projects.html, contact.html, and thankyou.html pages. Included semantic HTML5 markup, CSS Grid/Flexbox layouts, responsive design, and JavaScript form validation with password confirmation.
- **Decision:** Accepted
- **Why:** The output met all assignment requirements including accessibility features, semantic structure, responsive design, and form validation. The code was well-organized and followed modern web development best practices.

### Prompt 2
- **Prompt:** "Add comprehensive CSS design system with CSS custom properties, responsive breakpoints, and accessibility-focused styling including focus states and high contrast colors."
- **AI Output (summary or snippet):** Created a complete CSS design system with root variables for colors, spacing, typography, and layout. Implemented mobile-first responsive design with breakpoints at 640px and 1024px. Added WCAG AA compliant color contrast and visible focus states.
- **Decision:** Accepted
- **Why:** The CSS system provided excellent organization, maintainability, and accessibility compliance. The responsive design worked well across all device sizes and the color scheme met accessibility standards.

### Prompt 3
- **Prompt:** "Implement JavaScript form validation with real-time password confirmation checking, accessible error messages, and proper form submission handling."
- **AI Output (summary or snippet):** Created comprehensive form validation including HTML5 validation attributes, JavaScript password matching, accessible error messaging with aria-live regions, and proper form submission flow to thankyou.html page.
- **Decision:** Accepted
- **Why:** The validation system was robust, accessible, and user-friendly. It properly handled edge cases and provided clear feedback to users while maintaining accessibility standards.

## 150-Word Reflection

The AI assistance was invaluable for this project, particularly in generating the comprehensive CSS design system and implementing complex form validation logic. The AI excelled at creating semantic HTML structure and ensuring accessibility compliance throughout the codebase. However, I had to modify some placeholder content to make it more realistic and assignment-appropriate. The AI sometimes generated overly generic content that needed personalization for the specific university assignment context. I balanced AI assistance with manual review by carefully checking all accessibility features, testing responsive breakpoints, and ensuring the form validation worked correctly across different scenarios. The AI saved significant time in boilerplate code generation and complex CSS layout implementation, but I made sure to validate all code against the assignment requirements and accessibility standards. The final result demonstrates a good balance between AI efficiency and human oversight for quality assurance.
